# Connections

This project aims to provide a platorm for you to register and keep track of the people you know, meet or interact with in  both a professional or personal basis. Ever need a favor? Every helped someone with something? This platform will help keep track the favors you're owed. Find help when you need it and at no imediate cost. When someone needs help, facilitate their life, help out too. The more you give, the more you get back in return.

For now I will be developing the application in my spare time.
Once it has the minimum amount of features I will place it online for everyone to be able to use.
